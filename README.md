## Introduction

Album AI is an experimental project that uses the recently released gpt-4o-mini as a visual model to automatically identify metadata from image files in the album. It then leverages RAG technology to enable conversations with the album.

It can be used as a traditional photo album or as an image knowledge base to assist LLM in content generation.

## Story

As a photography enthusiast facing terabytes of photos, I often felt overwhelmed. All existing photo management software required extra effort to maintain. Haiku and the newly released gpt-4o-mini gave me hope. So I decided to implement it immediately. My partner and I created the first version in less than 24 hours.

We hope you'll like it too. We welcome any praise or criticism. Don't forget to give us a ‚≠êÔ∏è or share to let more people know about it.

## Demo
Coming soon.
<!-- We deployed an example on Render, you can see how it works:
[album.gcui.ai](https://album.gcui.ai) -->

## Features

- Automatically discover images in the album, using a PgSQL database for storage.
- Utilize GPT-4-o-mini to automatically generate metadata for images.
- Use OpenAI's Embedding API for metadata vectorization.
- Provide two APIs:
  - Search: A traditional Search API that takes a query and returns the most relevant images.
  - Chat: A RAG API that takes a query, retrieves images, and generates responses.
- One-click deployment to platforms like Render that support Docker container deployment.
- A permissive open-source license allows for integration and modification (please contact us for commercial use).

## How to start using?

Recommended to run locally, if you want to run on a server, please deploy yourself, and we will improve this part of the guide.

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gcui-art/album-ai.git
cd album-ai
```

### 2. Modify the .env

```bash
cp .env.prod.example .env.prod
```

Open `.env.prod` with your favorite editor, modify the configuration:

```bash
HOST_NAME= # Your local IP address, usually 192.168.x.x:8080
PROXY_URL= # Your local proxy IP address, usually 192.168.x.x:7890, required when accessing OpenAI API directly is not available
```


Configure OPENAI_API_KEY in docker-compose.yml:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY= # Your openai api key
```

### 3. Build and run the project

```bash
chmod a+x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

### 4. Enjoy!

Open the browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the demo.

### 5. Add new photos

Open the `images` directory in the project, add new photos to the `images` directory, and the background will automatically recognize and vectorize metadata. After that, you can use it in the demo through search and chat.

## API Reference

Album AI currently implements the following APIs:
